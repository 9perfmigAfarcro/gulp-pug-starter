If you are wondering how to use the Preproduction Blueprint Worksheet, here are some tips and examples to help you out.
  
## Step 1: Idea
  
In this step, you need to write down your idea and concept for your game environment or level design. You need to answer these questions:

- What is your idea? (write 1-2 sentences describing your idea)
- Is this a stand-alone game environment or a playable level design? (circle one)
- What software will you use for this project? (list of software/game engine you will use for this project)

For example, let's say you want to create a game environment based on the Chernobyl disaster. You could write something like this:

> Idea: I want to create a realistic and immersive game environment that depicts the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. The player will explore the abandoned city of Pripyat and the surrounding exclusion zone, witnessing the effects of radiation and decay on the environment and the wildlife.
> 
> 
> 
> Stand-alone game environment
> 
> 
> 
> Software: Unreal Engine 4, Blender, Photoshop

## Step 2: Settings, Location and Theme
  
In this step, you need to choose your setting, location, and theme for your game environment or level design. You need to answer these questions:

- What is your environment setting? (list physical environment setting your world takes place in)
- What are your key locations? (list more specific key locations)
- What is your theme? (list subject matter, dominant and unifying theme your environment takes place in)

For example, continuing with the Chernobyl idea, you could write something like this:

> Environment setting: post-apocalyptic urban wasteland
> 
> 
> 
> Key locations: Pripyat city center, amusement park, hospital, school, hotel, reactor 4, Duga radar station
> 
> 
> 
> Theme: disaster, survival, horror, decay

## Step 3: Project Purpose
  
In this step, you need to determine your project purpose and reason for creating your game environment or level design. You need to answer these questions:

- Why do you want to create this environment? (describe why you want to work on and finish this project)
- What do you want to achieve? (list or sentence of what you want to achieve from completing this project)
- What is your project purpose? (write a single sentence or a couple of bulleted points describing your project purpose of why you want to pursue and create this environment/level)

For example, continuing with the Chernobyl idea, you could write something like this:

> I want to create this environment because I am fascinated by the history and the atmosphere of the Chernobyl disaster. I have always wanted to visit the exclusion zone and see it for myself. I also want to challenge myself as a game developer and create a realistic and immersive game environment that can capture the mood and the details of the real location.
> 
> 
> 
> From completing this project, I want to achieve:
> 
> - A portfolio piece that showcases my skills and creativity as a game developer
> - A personal satisfaction of creating something that I am passionate about
> - A learning experience of working with Unreal Engine 4 and other software tools
> - A feedback from other developers and players who will play or view my game environment
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Project purpose: To create a realistic and immersive game environment that depicts the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.

## Step 4: Features
  
In this step, you need to define your unique features and player's experience for your game environment or level design. You need to answer these questions:

- What does your environment feature that is unique to your idea?
- What do you want the player to experience?
- How will your environment be different and unique from anything else out there?
- How will you define your environment and create a unique world for the player to experience?
- What are your feature list? (create 3-5 features that 8cf37b1e13
