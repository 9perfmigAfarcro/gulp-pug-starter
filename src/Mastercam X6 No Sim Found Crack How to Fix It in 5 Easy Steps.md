The "No Sim Found" error means that Mastercam cannot detect the HASP (Hardware Against Software Piracy) device that is required to run the software. The HASP device is a USB dongle that contains the license information for Mastercam. Without it, Mastercam will not run.
 
There are several reasons why Mastercam may not be able to find the HASP device. Here are some common causes and solutions:
 
- **Outdated HASP drivers:** The HASP drivers are the software components that allow Mastercam to communicate with the HASP device. If the drivers are outdated or incompatible with your Windows version, Mastercam may not be able to recognize the HASP device. To fix this, you need to update the HASP drivers to the latest version. You can download the latest HASP drivers from [this link](https://sentinelcustomer.gemalto.com/sentineldownloads/). After downloading, run the HASPUserSetup.exe file and follow the instructions to install the drivers. Restart your computer and try running Mastercam again.
- **Corrupted HASP codes:** The HASP codes are the license information that is stored in the HASP device. If the codes are corrupted or expired, Mastercam may not be able to validate your license and give you the "No Sim Found" error. To fix this, you need to update the HASP codes with a valid license file from your Mastercam reseller. You can contact your reseller and request a new license file for your HASP device. Once you receive the file, save it to your computer and run the NHaspX.exe file located in C:\Program Files\mcamx6 folder. This will open the NetHASP Code Update dialog box. Click on Update Code button and browse to the location of your license file. Click on Open and then OK to update your HASP codes. Restart your computer and try running Mastercam again.
- **Windows update interference:** Sometimes, a recent Windows update may interfere with the communication between Mastercam and the HASP device and cause the "No Sim Found" error. To fix this, you need to uninstall the problematic Windows update and prevent it from installing again. You can follow [this thread](https://www.emastercam.com/forums/topic/72074-no-sim-found/) on eMastercam.com forum for more details on how to do this.

If none of these solutions work for you, you may have a faulty or damaged HASP device that needs to be replaced. You can contact your Mastercam reseller or [Mastercam customer service](https://www.mastercam.com/en-us/Support/Customer-Service) for further assistance.
